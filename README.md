# Audio Recorder â€” WAV Only (10s max, Reset, single Upload)
- WAV (16-bit PCM, mono). 10s auto-stop. Reset cancels the take.
- Filename: `userID_G_AGE_audio_dd_mm_yyyy_hh_mm_ss.wav`.
- Set `WEB_APP_URL` in `index.html`, then publish `index.html`, `recorder-worklet.js`, `.nojekyll` to your public Pages repo.
- Backend: deploy `Code.gs` as a Web App (Execute as Me; Anyone/Anyone with link).

- Done
